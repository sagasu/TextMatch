This Application is written in VisualStudio 2012.
I compressed entire working folder, so the analyst can see all the files that I used to create a solution.
I did not created a release application, or anything like that - I believe that it was not what I was asked for :)
I am a huge supporter of not keeping anything inside console applications, and not referencing directly .exe files, that's why Services project was created.

It took me 2 hours to do this (mainly because in a first approach I used Linq - to solve a problem in a more functional programming way, but I was not sure If this is what you expect, so as a final solution I return a typical imperative way of coding.

Happy Hacking,
